            {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible.
            Diversity of voices is important to our community, and we are serious when we say EVERYONE AND ANYONE. If you've never given a talk before, that's EVEN MORE reason to submit a proposal now! If you have any questions about what we're looking for, or you're just needing a little encouragement for your submission, please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:speak@cascadiajs.com">speak@cascadiajs.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
            where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
            is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees, organizers, and sponsor representatives to be professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
            ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy. Please see our <a href="https://github.com/cascadiajs/2016.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a> for further details.
